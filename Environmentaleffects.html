- More than 80,000 chemicals are registered for use in the United States. Some of these chemicals 
 are toxic to animals and humans, and some interfere with the bodyâ€™s hormone function. The ones that impact hormones are called endocrine disrupting chemicals, or endocrine disruptors, and are linked to a variety of diseases. Some endocrine disruptors have been shown to be obesogens, or involved in weight gain, and may be contributing to the obesity problem.
